# Notion Pages Structure

To organize project documentation in Notion, we recommend creating the following pages:

- **License** – includes the license text (AGPL-3.0-or-later) and notices.
- **Governance** – outlines roles, decision processes, release procedures, and security policies.
- **Data & Ethics** – covers data handling practices, privacy policies, and ethical guidelines.
- **Contributing** – describes how to contribute, DCO sign-off instructions, and PR requirements.
- **MOU** – templates and guidelines for pilots and partnerships.
