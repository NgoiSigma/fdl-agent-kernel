Dear [Partner/Grant Committee],

On behalf of NGOI-SIGMA, I am pleased to present our project for consideration. Σ-Avatarus / FDL Agent Kernel embodies our commitment to open-source agentic systems with formal‑dialectical logic and ethical safeguards. We believe this collaboration will yield significant benefits for the community and align with the objectives outlined in the attached proposal.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Fravahr Ormazd
