# FDL Agent Kernel

**Formally-Dialectical Logic Reasoning Core for GPT-based Agents**

---

## 🔍 Overview
The `fdl-agent-kernel` is a semantic reasoning module for GPT-based agents, based on formal-dialectical logic (FDL). Rather than responding reactively, the agent reasons structurally through contradiction and synthesis.

### ✨ Key Features
- 3-phase reasoning: **Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis**
- Lightweight and interpretable core (Python)
- Compatible with OpenAI Agents / SDK
- Includes semantic alignment filtering

---

## 💡 Why FDL?
As agents evolve, their capacity to think must evolve too. FDL introduces a structured logic layer where meaning unfolds in phases — like natural thought, not just reaction.

FDL supports:
- Deep semantic coherence
- Explainable decision paths
- Ethical constraint through structure

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fdl-agent-kernel.git
cd fdl-agent-kernel
```

Run the agent:
```python
from fdl_kernel import FDLAgent

agent = FDLAgent()
print(agent.respond("Power is the only path to order."))
```
